I am Bala, a PhD student in High Energy Physics at Texas A&M University, College Station. Most of my research in physics has been on finding efficient ways to compute scattering amplitudes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. I have also worked on inflationary cosmology in supergravity theories. My publications can be found [here](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=a%20B.Nagaraj.1&ui-citation-summary=true).

This website is here to mostly document my explorations in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some of the topics that I am currently interested in are:

1. Generative models such as VAEs and Diffusion models, 
2. Transformer models and their long-range avatars,
3. Few shot learning.
