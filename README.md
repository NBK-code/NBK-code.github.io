I am Bala, a PhD student in High Energy Physics at Texas A&M University, College Station.

This website is here to mostly document my explorations in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some of the topics that I am currently interested in are:

1. Generative models such as VAEs and Diffusion models, 
2. Transformer models and its long-range avatars,
3. Few shot learning.
