I am Balakrishnan Nagaraj, a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Electrical and Computer Science Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station. Most of my research in Machine Learning has been on modeling complex dynamical systems using Neural ODEs. Previously I finished my PhD in high energy physics where I worked on finding efficient ways to compute scattering amplitudes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. I have also worked on inflationary cosmology in supergravity theories. My publications can be found [here](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=a%20B.Nagaraj.1&ui-citation-summary=true).

This website is here to mostly document my explorations in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some of the topics that I am currently interested in are:

1. Continual Learning for LLMs, 
2. Continual Learning with new architectures,
3. Extremely long context LLMs.
